Tokyo Summer Temperatures
=========================

A analysis and visualisation exercise on a data set containing the maximum daily
temperature in Tokyo during the three months of summer going back over 100
years.

Analysis is done in Python3 on Jupyter, and uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for
charting.

This is a work in progress.
